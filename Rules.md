##SPECIAL MOVES
**LOB PASS:**
* Reciever and passer should be free from opponent in terms of one space in the direction of passer

**THROUGHBALL:** 
  * In all directions only criteria is that the landing space must be free

**SPECIAL PASS**
  * This is a variety of through pass that can be completed only with the range of 2 spaces in all directions
  * Like through pass the landing space must be free
  * One major difference is that the passing line can be non-linear
  * Consider a 4x4 grid ,the player (0,0) position can pass to field (1,2) 
  * This move is added to demonstrate the ability of ball control and passing in tight spaces 
  * This is a trade-mark characteristic of a *trequartista* like Silva, Iniestia, Bergkamp etc

**SHOOTING:**
  * Only in opposition "d box" can shoot through defenders
  * Only gk can block from scoring 
  * Others can pass to goal(i.e if no opponent is blocking )
