## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thyagchlzn/footballstrategygame/main/snapshots/home.png?raw=True)
</br>
* This project aims to showcase the strategic aspects of football in a unique way, differentiating itself from traditional football manager games that primarily prioritize player quality over specific roles. In this game, players are represented by numbers, each corresponding to a particular role on the field. There are seven roles available, and the goalkeeper position is fixed and unchangeable. Users have the freedom to select any formation and combine roles as they see fit, encouraging strategic thinking and adaptability.
  
* The game's core focus lies in reading the game and anticipating attacks, which are vital skills that set successful players apart. Detailed rules are provided in both the Rules.md file and within the application to ensure clarity on gameplay mechanics.

* During matches, players can receive move suggestions for individual players by interacting with them, enhancing the gameplay experience and aiding decision-making. Three game modes are available: single player, multiplayer, and scenarios.

### Gameplay

**Single  player mode**

1. In single-player and multiplayer modes, players can choose to play against the CPU or another human player. 
  
2. They also have the option to set their preferred playing style and the style of their opponents.
   
3. Two attacking styles are available: "positional football," based on Rinus Michels' legendary Ajax team from the late '70s, and "direct football," focused on quick goal-scoring. 
   
4. For the defensive phase, players can opt for "high press," emphasizing man-to-man pressing, or "sit back," where players fall back to form a rigid defensive structure. 
   
5. This gives the CPU the ability to play in four different styles.

**Scenario Mode**
1. In the scenario mode, players face a fixed CPU opponent and must achieve specific goals within a limited number of turns, presenting unique challenges.
2. These scenarios are based on iconic moments of the real football matches.
3. In other modes, players can customize the number of turns and goals through the "settings" menu.
